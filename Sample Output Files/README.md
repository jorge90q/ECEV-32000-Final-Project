# These are examples of the output files that will be saved after running the code
# A folder named "SRE Data files" will be created with the following:
# 1. Raw data for each condition as csv files, in case further rework of data is needed
# 2. Stats charts for each sample in an excel workbook
# 3. 4 Bar Graphs, one for each condition (luminescence and ratios), as PNGs to easily place into Powerpoints for lab meeting
